							<b>dealloc Method</b><br>
							When an object&aposs retain count reaches 0, it is sent a dealloc
							message. You will provide implementations of the dealloc
							method, which will call release on the instances retained
							variables. Do not call dealloc directly.

							<b>Autorelease Pools</b><br>
							An autorelease pool (NSAutoreleasePool) contains references to
							objects that have received an autorelease message. When the
							<b>autorelease</b> pool is deallocated, it sends a release message to
							all objects in the pool. Using an autorelease pool may simplify
							memory management; however, it is less fine grained and may
							allow an application to hold onto more memory than it really
							needs. Be watchful of which types and size of objects you use
							with autorelease.

							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Categories</b></section>
							Categories are a powerful language feature which allows
							you to add methods to an existing class without subclassing.
							Categories are useful to extend the features of existing classes
							and to split the implementation of large classes into several
							files. Categories are not subclasses. Generally, do not use
							methods in a category to extend existing methods except
							when you wish to globally erase and redefine the original
							method. Categories can not add instance variables to a class.

							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Xcode</b></section>
							The IDE included in the iOS SDK is named Xcode. It is the
							primary tool in the suite of utilities that ship with the SDK.
							Xcode has a long history but has been given a dramatic set
							of feature additions in the modern iPhone and iPad releases,
							including detection of common user-coded memory leaks and
							quick-fixing of other syntax and coding mistakes.
							Plain text editors and command line <b>Make</b> files can be used to
							produce iOS applications. However, Xcode offers compelling
							features such as syntax highlighting and code completion.
							These features make writing Objective-C in the Xcode IDE a
							delight and a favorite of developers everywhere.
							<p></p>
							<img src="Task\Pick_33.jpg" width="560px" />
							<p></p>
							Once the code is in a valid-syntax state, compile it by choosing
							Build <img src="Task\Pick_37.jpg" align="bottom" /> Build from the menus, or <img src="Task\Pick_38.jpg" align="bottom" /> B. If there are code errors,
							they will appear as a yellow or red icon in the lower right corner
							of the IDE. Clicking on the icon will reveal a panel detailing the
							warnings and errors.
							<p></p>
							<img src="Task\Pick_34.jpg" width="560px"/>
							<p></p>
							Deploying an application to the simulator has two simple steps.
							First, choose the <b>Simulator</b> target from the main Xcode toolbar.
							Building and Deploying can be done in one seamless step
							by pressing the Command and Enter keys. The simulator will
							receive the compiled application and launch it.
							<p></p>
							<img src="Task\Pick_35.jpg" width="auto"  hspace="100px"/>
							<p></p>
							To deploy to an iPhone or iPad, first select <b>Device</b> from the
							aforementioned toolbar menu. Second, right click on the
							element beneath the Target node of the <b>Groups and Files</b> tree
							and choose <b>Get Info</b>. Choose the <b>Properties</b> tab and ensure
							the Identifier matches the name or pattern you established with
							Apple for your Provisioning Profile at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone">http://developer.apple.com/iphone</a>

							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Debugging</b></section>
							The Xcode platform provides a robust debugger and
							supplementary mechanisms for stepping through code.
							Breakpoints are easily set by single clicking in the gutter next
							to any line of code. A blue arrow indicates a breakpoint is set
							and active.
							<p></p>
							<img src="Task\Pick_40.jpg" width="450px" height="100%" hspace="50px"/>

							the stack examined via the key combination <img src="Task\Pick_38.jpg" align="bottom" /> + <img src="Task\Pick_46.jpg" width="13px"align="bottom" /> + Y. The
							bottommost panel is called the console, and is where all

							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Interface Builder</b></section>
							A tool as powerful as Xcode is Interface Builder. Its name
							clearly expresses its use for designing Objective-C NIBs and
							XIBs, which are the binary and XML form of user interface
							definition files on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad.
							<p>NIBs, though graphically designed, actually instantiate the
							objects declared via the tool when called upon via code.
							Accordingly, it may help to think of IB (as it is known in the
							community) primarily as a class-instance designer and property
							value setter.</p>
							<p>New elements can be added to a design canvas in a dragand-
							drop WYSIWYG approach via the Library panel, which
							can be accessed via the <img src="Task\Pick_38.jpg" align="bottom" /> + <img src="Task\Pick_46.jpg" width="13px"align="bottom" /> +L key combination. After

							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Simulator</b></section>
							<p>The iPhone and iPad Simulator is another distinct application
							in the iPhone SDK that communicates and integrates with the
							Xcode IDE and with Interface Builder. In the Xcode section, we
							saw how to deploy our application to the Simulator, which both
							installs the application and launches it.</p>
							<p>While the Simulator offers a great desktop testing experience
							that requires no purchase of hardware, it has a few
							shortcomings such as the lack of a camera, gyroscope, or
							GPS facilities. The lack of camera is somewhat mitigated by a
							supply of several stock photos in the Photo application. The
							harsh absence of a gyroscope is minimized only by the shake
							and rotate gestures possible through the Hardware menu. And
							last, the omission of a true GPS simulator is performed by GPS
							calls always resolving to 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA, USA.</p>
							<p>The iPhone Simulator offers iPad, iPhone and iPhone 4
							simulation modes. The modes are toggled via the Hardware
							<img src="Task\Pick_37.jpg" align="bottom" /> Device menu.</p>
							<p></p>
							<img src="Task\Pick_44.jpg" width="560px" height="100%" />
							<p></p>
							The Simulator ships with a limited number of core applications;
							namely, the Photos, Settings, Camera, Contacts and
							Safari programs. These are the applications that offer API
							connectivity from the source code of your application. For a
							broader set of programs and more realistic mobile horsepower
							CPUs, testing on an actual iOS device is critical. Commercial
							apps that you&apos;ve purchased from the iTunes App Store cannot
							be installed on the Simulator for DRM reasons and the vast
							difference in CPU architecture of x86 desktops and ARM
							mobile devices.

							Currently, the unit testing tools for Objective-C are less mature

							similarly to those of xUnit tests in languages such as Java. The
							Google Toolbox for Mac provides several useful enhancements
							to OCUnit and is the testing solution currently recommended
							by ThoughtWorks for the iOS platform. Complementing
							OCUnit is OCMock, an Objective-C implementation of mock

									<p></p>
									Objective-C is the primary language used to create
									applications for Apple&prime;s Mac OS X and iOS (iPhone and iPad)
									platforms. Objective-C was created by Brad Cox and Tom Love
									in the early 1980s. In 1988, Objective-C was licensed by NeXT,
									a company founded and helmed by Steve Jobs during his
									absence from Apple. Apple acquired NeXT in 1996, bringing
									Objective-C to the Macintosh platform.
									<p></p>
									Objective-C is an object oriented superset of ANSI C. Its
									object syntax is derived from Smalltalk. It supports single
									inheritance, implementation of multiple interfaces via the
									<b>@protocol</b> syntax, and the redefinition and augmentation of
									(open) classes via categories. Apple&prime;s iPhone SDK for the
									iOS mobile operating system offers developers a rich set of
									Objective-C APIs. This free SDK, which includes the Xcode
									IDE, is used to create applications for the iPhone, iPad, and
									iPod Touch.
									<p></p>
							<section class="text_body_red"><section class="text_body_white_text"><b>THE SYNTAX</b></section></section>
							<p></p>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Class Declaration</b></section>
							Objective-C classes typically include an interface <b>.h</b> and an
							implementation <b>.m</b> pair of files. The <b>.h</b> file contains property
							and method declarations. The <b>.m</b> file contains method
							implementations.
							<p></p>
							<b>Example .h interface file</b>
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
 @interface Speaker : NSObject {
	NSInteger *ID;
	NSString *name;
 }
 @property NSInteger *ID;
 @property(nonatomic,retain) NSString *name;
 - (void) doSomething: (NSString *) value anotherValue: (int) value2;
 @end</section></pre>				
							<b>Example .m implementation file</b>
									<pre><section class="text_body_pink">#import &quot;Speaker.h&quot;
@implementation Speaker
@synthesize ID,name;
- (void) doSomething: (NSString *) value anotherValue: (int) value2 {
	// do something
}
@end</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Inheritance</b></section>
							Class inheritance is specified in the .h interface file with the
							syntax:<b> @interface &ltMyClass> : &ltParentClass></b>. The following
							example tells the compiler that the Employee class inherits
							from (extends) the Person class.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Employee.h file
@interface Employee : Person {
}
@end</section></pre>
							<img src="Task\Pick_4.jpg" width="560px"  />
							<p></p>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Interfaces</b></section>
							Objective-C interfaces are created using the <b>@protocol</b>
							declaration. Any class can implement multiple interfaces.
							Interfaces are typically declared in a <b>.h</b> header file and can be
							included via <b>#import</b> statements in the <b>.h</b> header file of other
							classes.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Mappable.h: Declare the Mappable @protocol
@protocol Mappable
- (double) latitude;
- (double) longitude;
@end

// Location.h: Specify that Location class implements the Mappable
// @protocol
#import &quot;Mappable.h&quot;
@interface Location : NSObject &lt;Mappable&gt; {
}
@end

// Location.m: Provide implementations for the Mappable methods
@implementation Location
- (double) latitude {
	return 46.553666;
}
- (double) longitude {
	return -87.40551;
}
@end</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Primitive Data Types</b></section>
							As a superset of ANSI C, Objective-C supports its same
							primitive data types.
							<p></p>
							<img src="Task\Pick_6.jpg" width="560px"  border="1px" />
							
							<p></p>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Common Object Data Types</b></section>
							<img src="Task\Pick_8.jpg" width="560px"  border="1px" />
							<p></p>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Instance Variables</b></section>
							Class instance variables are declared within a curly braced {}
							section of the <b>.h</b> file.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Book.h: Variables declared in a header file
@interface Book : NSObject {
	NSString *title;
	NSString *author;
	int pages;
}
@end</section></pre>
							Notice that the object variable declarations are preceded by
							* symbol. This indicates that the reference is a pointer to an
							object and is required for all object variable declarations.
							<p></p>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Dynamic Typing</b></section>
							Objective-C supports dynamic typing via the <b>id</b> keyword.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">NSString *name1 = @&quot;Bob&quot;;
// name2 is a dynamically typed NSString object
id name2 = @@&quot;Bob@&quot;;
if ([name1 isEqualToString:name2]) {
	// do something
}</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Methods</b></section>
							Methods are declared in the <b>.h</b> header file and implemented in
							the <b>.m</b> implementation file.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Book.h: Declare methods in the header file
@interface Book : NSObject {
}
- (void) setPages: (int) p;
- (int) pages;
@end

- (void) setPages: (int) p {
	pages = p;
}
- (int) pages {
	return pages;
}
@end</section></pre>
							<img src="Task\Pick_12.jpg" width="560px" />
							<p></p>
							<b>Using Dot Notation Method Invocation</b>
							<p></p>
							Objective-C 2.0 added the ability to invoke property accessor
							methods (getters/setters) using &quot.&quot notation.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Using dot notation calls the book instance&apos;s setAuthor method
book.author = @@&quot;Herman Melville@&quot;;
// equivalent to
[book setAuthor: @@&quot;Herman Melville@&quot;];</section></pre>
							<b>Multi Parameter Methods</b><p></p>
							Multi-Parameter methods are more verbose than other
							languages. Each parameter includes both an external name,
							data type, and a local variable name. The external parameter
							name becomes a formal part of the method name.
								<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// declare a method with multiple parameters
- (void) addBookWithTitle: (NSString *) aTitle andAuthor: (NSString *)
anAuthor;

// invoke a method with multiple parameters
[self addBookWithTitle: @@&quot;Moby Dick@&quot; andAuthor: 
@@&quot;Herman Melville@&quot;];</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Self and Super Properties</b></section>
							Objective-C objects include a <b>self</b> property and a <b>super</b>
							property. These properties are mutable and can be assigned
							in an advanced technique called &quotswizzling&quot. Most commonly,
							the <b>self</b> attribute is used to execute a method on the
							enclosing object.
								<pre><section class="text_body_pink">[self setAuthor: @&quot;Herman Melville&quot;];
// Invoke methods on the &quot;super&quot; property to execute parent class
// behavior. a method that overrides a parent class method 
// will likely call the parent class method
- (void) doSomething: (NSString *)value {
	[super doSomething: value];
	// do something derived-class specific
}</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Properties using @property and @synthesize</b></section>
								Objective-C 2.0 added property declaration syntax in order to
								reduce verbose coding of getter and setter methods.
									<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// use of @property declaration for the title variable is equivalent
// to declaring a &quot;setTitle&quot; mutator and &quot;title&quot; accessor method.
@interface Book : NSObject {
	NSString *title;
}
@property (retain, nonatomic) NSString *title;
@end

// use the @synthesize declaration in the .m implementation file
// to automatically implement setter and getter methods.
@implementation Book
@synthesize title, author; //Multiple variables
@synthesize pages; //Single variable
@end</section></pre>
							Multiple variables may be included in a single @synthesize
							declaration. Alternatively, a class may include multiple
							@synthesize declarations.
							<p></p>
							<b>@property Attributes</b>
							<p>
							Property attributes specify behaviors of generated getter
							and setter methods. Attribute declarations are placed in
							parenthesis () after the @property declaration. The most
							common values used are (retain, nonatomic). retain
							indicates that the [retain] method should be called on the
							newly assigned value object. See the memory management
							section for further explanation. nonatomic indicates that
							the assignment operation does not check for thread access
							protection, which may be necessary in multi-threaded
							environments. readonly may be specified to indicate the
							property&apos;s value can not be set.</p>
							<p></p>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Object Initialization</b></section>
							Object instances are created in two steps. First, with a call to
							alloc and second, with a call to init.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// example of 2 step object initialization
Book *book = [[Book alloc] init];
// equivalent to
Book *book2 = [Book alloc];
book2 = [book init];</section></pre>
							In order to perform specific object initialization steps, you will
							often implement the <b>init</b> or an <b>initWith</b> method. Notice
							the syntax used around the <b>self</b> property in the following
							example. This is a standard init pattern found in Objective-C.
							Also notice the method uses a dynamic <b>id</b> return type.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Event.m: Implementation overrides the &quot;init&quot; method to assign a 
//default date value
@implementation Event
- (id) init {
	self = [super init];
	if (self != nil) {
		self.date = [[NSDate alloc] init];
	}
	return self;
}
@end</section></pre>
							<b>Class Constructors</b><br>
							Classes often include constructor methods as a convenience.
							The method type is <b>+</b> to indicate that it is a class (static)
							method.
								<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Constructor method declaration
+ (Book *) createBook: (NSString *) aTitle withAuthor: (NSString *)
anAuthor;

// Invoke a class constructor
Book *book2 = [Book createBook: @&quot;Moby Dick&quot; withAuthor: @&quot;Herman
Melville&quot;];</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>#import Statements</b></section>
							<b>#import</b> statements are required to declare the classes and
							frameworks used by your class. <b>#import</b> statements can be
							included at the top of both <b>.h</b> header and <b>.m</b> implementation
							files.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// import a class

							@&quotHello World&quot). This creates instances of the NSString class;
							instead of C language CFStrings.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// create a string literal via the &quot;@&quot; symbol
NSString *value = @&quot;foo bar&quot;;
NSString *value2 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@&quot;foo %@&quot;,@&quot;bar&quot;];
// string comparison
if ([value isEqualToString:value2]) {
	// do something
}
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;];
NSString *value3 = [NSString stringWithContentsOfURL:url];
NSString *value4 = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile: @&quot;file.txt&quot;];</section></pre>
							<b>NSLog / NSString Formatters</b>
							<br>
							Formatters are character sequences used for variable
							substitution in strings.
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">%@ for objects
%d for integers
%f for floats
// Logs &quot;Bob is 10 years old&quot;
NSLog(@&quot;%@ is %d years old&quot;, @&quot;Bob&quot;, 10);</section></pre>
							<section class="text_red_text"><b>Data Structures</b></section>
							<b>Using NSArray</b>
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// Create a fixed size array. Notice that nil termination is required
NSArray *values = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;One&quot;,@&quot;Two&quot;,nil];
// Get the array size
int count = [values count];
// Access a value
NSString *value = [values objectAtIndex:0];
// Create a variable sized array
NSMutableArray *values2 = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
[values2 addObject:@&quot;One&quot;];</section></pre>
							<b>Using NSDictionary</b>
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">NSDictionary *di = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
	@&quot;One&quot;,[NSNumber numberWithInt:1],
	@&quot;Two&quot;,[NSNumber numberWithInt:2],nil];
NSString *one = [di objectForKey: [NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];
NSMutableDictionary *di2 = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[di2 setObject:@&quot;One&quot; forKey:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];</section></pre>
<section class="text_red_text"><b>Memory Management</b></section>
							Objective-C 2.0 includes garbage collection. However,
							garbage collection is not available for iOS apps. iOS apps
							must manage memory by following a set of object ownership
							rules. Each object has a retain count which indicates the
							number of objects with an ownership interest in that object.
							Ownership of an object is automatically taken when you call a
							method beginning with <b>alloc</b>, prefixed with <b>new</b>, or containing
							<b>copy</b>. Ownership is manually expressed by calling the <b>retain</b>
							method. You relinquish object ownership by calling <b>release</b> or
							<b>autorelease</b>.
							<p></p>
							When an object is created it has a retain count of 1<br>
							When the &quotretain&quot message is sent to an object, the retain count is incremented by 1<br>
							When the &quotrelease&quot message is sent to an object, the retain count is decremented by 1<br>
							When the retain count reaches 0, it is deallocated
							<pre><section class="text_body_pink">// alloc sets the retain count to 1
Book *book = [[Book alloc] init];
// do something...

// Release message decrements the retain count,
// Retain count reaches 0. Book will be deallocated
[book release];</section></pre>
